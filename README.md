# Super-Tic-Tac-Toe
Super Tic Tac Toe is an extreme version of the regular Tic Tac Toe game. I programmed it from scratch in Python using the curses module and got my inspiration for this project from a YouTube video by Vsauce. that runs on the terminal. Built on Python language and curses module.

## Installation

 Run it locally by following these steps


Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Akil-Adnan/Flappy-Bird.git
```

Go to project directory
```
cd my-project
```

If Windows OS, install the curses library
```
pip install curses
```

Run the game
```
python main.py
```

    
## Troubleshoot

Use a proper terminal if this error shows up:

```
_curses.error: setupterm: could not find terminal
```

Zoom out the terminal window by using ```Ctrl``` + ```-``` or ```Ctrl``` + ```shift``` + ```-``` for this error.
```
_curses.error: wmove() returned ERR
```
